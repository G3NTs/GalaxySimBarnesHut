## Introduction

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of N-Body simulations using the Barnes-Hut algorithm. Developed by Wouter Dobbenberg (s1722980) as part of a university assignment, this project explores celestial mechanics through efficient simulation techniques and emphasizes proficiency in Python coding.

## Features

- **N-Body Simulation**: Simulate the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.
- **Barnes-Hut Algorithm**: Enhanced computational efficiency using the Barnes-Hut criteria.
- **Velocity Verlet Integration**: Accurate and efficient position and velocity updates.
- **Quad/Oct-Trees**: Spatial partitioning for optimized force calculations.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-body-simulations.git
    cd n-body-simulations
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - matplotlib Pyplot
   - matplotlib animation
   - numpy
   - math
   - random

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

1. Navigate to the code directory.
2. Execute the Final.py simulation script:
    ```bash
    python Final.py
    ```

### Customizing the Simulation

You can modify the parameters of the simulation such as the number of bodies, initial conditions in the `SimulationPresets.py` file. Other settings can be changed within the `settings.py` file.

### Project Report

A more detailed report of the workings of the code can be found as a pdf file in this repository. It goes into detail explaning the code, and functions as the documentation.
